# test-doubles-examples

Some runnable (and commented) code examples to illustrate the types of test double available to us. Examples are currently provided with Ruby/Rspec - PRs welcome.

To run the tests, `cd` to `./ruby/rspec` and then `bundle install` before `bundle exec rspec`. These examples are written with Ruby `3.1.1` and RSpec `3.11`.
